# Company password policy

## 1. Policy statement

This document outlines the enforced password policy across all IT-controlled 
systems, devices, servers, and user accounts managed by the company. 
All systems are protected with a unique username, password, and additional 
multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods for authorized and protected usage.
 
The contents of this document establish a standard for the management of passwords 
for company-approved IT systems. The policy defines the password construction 
requirement (complexity, prohibitions, etc.), user responsibility, and MFA requirements.
 The established standard will help protect the confidential/sensitive 
data of employees/users, the company, and customers.

## 2. Policy scope

The scope of the policy involves any application, account, server, network device, 
or other electronic device approved by IT for the business use of the company, 
connected to the company network (local and remote) or electronic locations 
where business information is stored.

## 3. Policy

The following company security requirements are in effect for all employees, 
contractors, and other users as approved by IT for standard non-privileged-user 
account and system passwords: 

- A password cannot be changed to any of the most 
recent 24 passwords. 

- Must be changed no less frequently than every 60 days—user will receive email 
notifications to change password starting at two weeks, one week, three days, and 
then 24 hours before the 60th day. 

- Cannot be changed more frequently than once per day. 
- A user account will be locked for 60 minutes after three incorrect password attempts within 60 minutes.
- A user account will be locked after three additional incorrect password attempts are made, i.e., six incorrect attempts in a row—must contact IT services for assistance to unlock the account.  
- Avoid writing passwords down. 
- Do not share passwords with others. 
- Users are encouraged to use secure, encrypted password management software for password storage and generation that complies with the standards outlined in this policy—web browser-based extensions and password managers are strictly prohibited. 
- Password construction must meet the requirements outlined in section [4. Password management](#password-management) 
- Users are required to enable MFA outlined in section [5. Multifactor authentication (MFA)](#multifactor-authentication) 

*If a user does not change their password on or before 60 days, the password will expire; 
the user will receive an email notification with steps for submitting 
a force password change request.* 

*Examples of non-browser-based password management software: **Bitwarden**, **1Password***

## 4. Password management

#### *Password Construct & Complexity – User responsibility* 
To ensure confidentiality and a strong defense, the password chosen by you must meet the following requirements:


* Must be at least 14 characters in length.

* Must contain at least:

  * Two uppercase letters \[A-Z\]

  * Two lowercase letters \[a-z\]

  * Two digits \[0-9\]

  * Two special characters \[e.g.:\!@\#$%\*\]

  * A new password should differ from the changed password by at least 4 characters.

  * A password cannot contain your account name, username, display name, or any other information relating to personal identification.

Example: If account name = John.Doe

		And username = jdoe

		And display name = John Doe Systems Administrator NE Florida

Then regardless of case, the following cannot be any part of a password:

*john, doe, jdoe, systems, administrator, ne, florida*

## 5. Multifactor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) reduces security risks that could pose a threat to 
confidential/sensitive company data by requiring users to provide two or more 
verification factors to gain access to any IT-approved and company-managed 
application, server, network device, or other electronic device for business use. 

Users are required to enable MFA upon account creation and access. 
To enable MFA, after logging in, go to My Account → Settings → Privacy & Security → Enable MFA. 

The following MFA methods are approved for all users in addition to the password created following the 
standards outlined in this document: 
- SMS – receive a text message with a one-time code to enter after logging in with username and password. 
- Authenticator app – enter a time-sensitive code, generated in the authenticator app, after logging in with username and password. 

***Note:* MFA methods (SMS or authenticator app) for logging into company devices, IT systems, etc., will only 
be required every 7 days, per user, per device/system.*
